# Neural-Nets



Kernel2cf9112467 : Is a solution to IEEE-Fraud Detection Competition on Kaggle. 
The notebook is featuring a bagging ensemble approach consisting of 20 neural networks trained in deferent parts of the full dataset, 
and finally a metaclassifier which provides the final fraud probabilities.                                                          




NN_Attrition: Based on data from kaggle I developed a simpe shallow neural network targeting to identify the employs affected be attrition,
beforhand an EDA and data cleaning was been conducted in order to make the model more accurate.
